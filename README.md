# Weather Was
Note: _The weather API used in this project is still in beta and the data coming back may have inaccuracies._ In your everyday weather app you'll see what the weather _is_ and what it _might be_, but you'll never see  what the weather _was._ Incidentally, most people live on the ground, not in the sky, so their primary concern is what the weather _was_ so they can deduce ground conditions. Your everyday weather app might say 36°F / 2°C and sunny skies this morning, but did it freeze last night? Is there black ice on the roads? You need _Weather Was._

#### Motivation
Long before the days of smartphones, even before the household-ization of the internet, people have often asked why meteorologists are overly concerned with what might happen to the sky when they could prevent more traffic accidents explaining what already happen to the ground. *Knowing what the weather was saves lives.*
